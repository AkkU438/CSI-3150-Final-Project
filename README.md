## Overview

The Grand Master Trivia Engine is a gamified, time-pressured quiz application built with React. Players choose a knowledge domain and difficulty, then race against a 15-second per-question countdown to answer 10 questions fetched live from the Open Trivia DB API. Scores are persisted in localStorage and displayed in a Hall of Fame leaderboard.

The app features three clearly-managed game states (START_SCREEN → QUIZ_ACTIVE → RESULTS_SCREEN), Web Audio API generated sound effects, CSS animation feedback (green flash for correct, red shake for wrong), and a Fisher-Yates shuffle ensuring unique answer orderings every run.

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Timer cleanup preventing memory leaks
The 15-second countdown uses `setInterval` inside a `useEffect`. The critical requirement is returning a **cleanup function** (`return () => clearInterval(interval)`) so the interval is destroyed when the component unmounts or when dependencies change. Without this, stale intervals would fire callbacks on unmounted components, causing errors and memory leaks.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => { /* ... */ }, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval); // CLEANUP
}, [currentIndex, selectedAnswer]);
```

### 2. HTML entity decoding
The OTDB API encodes special characters as HTML entities (`&#039;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`). A `decodeHTML()` utility using a hidden `<textarea>` element resolves them into readable text before rendering.

### 3. Fisher-Yates shuffle for unbiased answer ordering
A naive `array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` produces biased permutations. The Fisher-Yates algorithm iterates backwards through the array swapping each element with a randomly chosen earlier element, guaranteeing uniform distribution.

### 4. Web Audio API for zero-dependency sounds
All sound effects (correct chord, wrong buzz, timer tick, results fanfare) are synthesised programmatically via the `AudioContext` API — no external audio files are required, keeping the bundle lightweight.

### 5. localStorage leaderboard persistence
After every quiz the top-5 scores are sorted by accuracy percentage and saved with `JSON.stringify` / `localStorage.setItem`. On mount, the `StartScreen` reads them back with `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(...) || '[]')` to populate the Hall of Fame.

## Features Checklist

### Detailed Requirements
- [x] Dynamic API Fetching — Open Trivia DB, user-selected category + difficulty
- [x] 15-second countdown timer with auto-advance on timeout
- [x] Three game states: `START_SCREEN`, `QUIZ_ACTIVE`, `RESULTS_SCREEN`
- [x] Fisher-Yates shuffle for randomised answer ordering

### Advanced Features
- [x] Sound & Visuals — Web Audio API tones; green flash (correct) and red shake (wrong) CSS animations
- [x] High-Score Leaderboard — Top 5 scores persisted in `localStorage`, shown on Start & Results screens

### Error Handling
- [x] Loading spinner while fetching questions
- [x] User-facing error messages (network failure, insufficient questions for category/difficulty)
- [x] HTML entity decoding for API responses
